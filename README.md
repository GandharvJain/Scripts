# Python scripts for Ubuntu
* spotifyAddToPlaylist.py: Add current playing song on spotify to existing playlist.
* browserswitch.py: Cycle forward or backward through all open windows in custom order. Modified from [this post](https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1204947&p=10455867#post10455867) on the Ubuntu forum. Can be used to cycle windows in the order on the dock.
